# This is a Siemens PLC interface made with Electron.js and Chart.js
I was asked to create an app that communicates with a Siemens S7 PLC, reads data from a DataBlock, saves the values in a Database and also plots the data on Charts.

1. Im using Nodes7 for the communication between the app and the PLC.

1. The Database technology is yet to be determined even though i started with MongoDB interfaced with mongoose at some point i realised that i had many problems with it so im thinking of using PostgreSQL.

1. Im using Chart.js to plot the data that got saved in the database, its an interesting library even though im miles away from mastering it.
